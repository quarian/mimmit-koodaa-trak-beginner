This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What is this?

This is a learning environment for hte Futurice Mimmit Koodaa 2019 Data Structures and Algorithms beginner course.
It offers visualizations and boilerplate to help workshop participants to write and learn about algorithms.

## What's inside?

In the different folders (`Misc`, `Stack` and `Sorting`) you'll find differnet visaulisations and skeleton implementations
of the algorithms. Once you start implementing them you can use the visualisations to test them.

If you are present at the workshop, the instructors will guide you. If you are learning on your own, take you time
to explore. The folder structure is shallow and should be easy to understand.
